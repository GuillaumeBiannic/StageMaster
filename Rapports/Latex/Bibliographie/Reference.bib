abstract = "Patients with anorexia nervosa frequently believe they are larger than they really are. The precise nature of this bias is not known: is it a false belief related to the patient's aesthetic and emotional attitudes towards her body? Or could it also reflect abnormal processing of the representation of the body in action? We tested this latter hypothesis by using a body-scaled action-anticipation task in which 25 anorexics and 25 control participants had to judge whether or not an aperture was wide enough for them to pass through. The anticipation of body-scaled action was severely disturbed in anorexic patients; they judged that they could not pass through an aperture, even when it was wide enough (i.e. they behave as if their body was larger than in reality). The abnormally high “passability ratio” (the critical aperture size to shoulder width ratio) was also correlated with the duration of illness and the degree of body concern/dissatisfaction. Our results suggest that body size overestimation in anorexia nervosa is not solely due to psycho-affective factors but rather suggest impaired neural processing of body dimensions that might take its source in parietal networks.

abstract = "Résumé L’anorexie mentale est une maladie psychiatrique extrêmement grave qui apparaît, le plus souvent, chez la jeune fille, à l’adolescence. Cette pathologie mentale se traduit notamment par une restriction alimentaire drastique, mettant en jeu la vie de la jeune fille, et par une surestimation de la silhouette et du poids du corps. L’objectif de cette revue est de voir quels peuvent être les apports issus de la psychologie cognitive et de la neuropsychologie dans la compréhension de cette maladie. Les études montrent que l’organisation perceptive, la flexibilité mentale, la mémoire de travail et la cohérence centrale sont des composantes qui sont particulièrement affectées. L’intégration multisensorielle, sous-tendue par le cortex pariétal, serait également perturbée chez certaines patientes. Mais surtout, les études sur la surestimation du corps révèlent que cette illusion s’ancrerait dans une représentation sensorimotrice du corps : le schéma corporel. La prise de conscience de la maigreur étant une condition indispensable à la réussite du processus de renutrition, les thérapies ne doivent pas négliger dans leur programme des techniques centrées sur une meilleure conscience et acceptation du corps. La réalité virtuelle ou le contact réel avec le corps par le biais de massages, lorsque c’est possible émotionnellement pour la patiente, pourrait être utilisés en adjonction à la psychothérapie. Summary Anorexia nervosa is an extremely serious psychiatric illness that appears during adolescence. This illness is an eating disorder and mainly affects young women who, according to studies, account for nine out of 10 sufferers. It is characterized by the following three symptoms (DSM-5, 2013): (i) a calorie-restrictive diet in relation to the physiological needs of the individual which leads to rapid and massive weight loss, (ii) an intense fear of weight gain, even when extremely low weight has been reached, and (iii) distorted self body representation, in particular an exaggeration of weight and body shape. The patients see themselves as bigger than they actually are. This symptom is extremely important, as it is likely to counteract the effects of therapy, as the patient never reaches their “ideal” weight. In addition, according to researchers, dissatisfaction with body shape could be a precursor to the illness. Many researchers in genetics, neurobiology and psychology have attempted to gain better understanding of this pathology in order to find efficient treatment or therapy. It is clear that, although many treatments and therapies now exist, their effectiveness is still very limited, even for cognitive and behavioral therapy. However, the situation is urgent as anorexia nervosa can lead to death through malnutrition but also suicide. This pathology has the highest suicide rate of all psychiatric disorders. Thus, it would seem important to undertake further research to gain better understanding of this pathology. The aim of this review is to see how studies in the field of cognitive neuropsychology can contribute to improving the care and treatment of patients. With regard to intellectual ability, studies lack consensus and it is necessary to carry out wider experiments with larger control groups. However, it would seem that patients, once they reach a very low weight, perform less well in classic intelligent tests, affecting all sub-scores. This result could be connected to the decrease in the volume of grey matter that has been evidenced. Fortunately, patients seem to show improved performances once they have regained weight. Like personality studies that have shown that certain characteristics such as perfectionism, asceticism and fear of maturity are linked to this illness, data from cognitive neuropsychology seems to highlight certain specific components. Perceptive organization, mental flexibility, short-term memory and central coherence are all components that appear to be particularly affected by anorexia nervosa. Adapted and individualized cognitive therapy could be offered to improve the affected components, such as weak cognitive flexibility that can be an obstacle to change the behavior. In addition, studies on the exaggeration of body shape and weight (frequent complaints of patients) show that this illusion does not only concern conscious, emotional and aesthetic body image, but is also linked to a more basic, sensory-motor representation: the body schema. The parietal cortex seems to be involved in this disorder of body schema. Self-awareness about the body is a key element in the success of the renutrition process. The therapies should focus on the body with real contact (via massage for instance) and with the help of virtual reality. This could enhance the re-appropriation of the new limits of the emaciated body and could permit also to more accept the actual and future enlarged body during the renutrition process. Finally, experimental paradigms from cognitive psychology that explore non-classical functions such as multi-sensorial integration and the use of brain imaging techniques should lead to better understanding of the underlying neural systems. This information could be added to existing knowledge about anorexia nervosa in order to refine therapies offered and to improve the individual treatment of these patients experiencing deep psychic and physical pain.

abstract ={Obesity and eating disorders are usually considered unrelated problems with different causes. However, various studies identify unhealthful weight-control behaviors (fasting, vomiting, or laxative abuse), induced by a negative experience of the body, as the common antecedents of both obesity and eating disorders. But how might negative body image—common to most adolescents, not only to medical patients—be behind the development of obesity and eating disorders?In this paper, I review the “allocentric lock theory” of negative body image as the possible antecedent of both obesity and eating disorders.Evidence from psychology and neuroscience indicates that our bodily experience involves the integration of different sensory inputs within two different reference frames: egocentric (first-person experience) and allocentric (third-person experience). Even though functional relations between these two frames are usually limited, they influence each other during the interaction between long- and short-term memory processes in spatial cognition. If this process is impaired either through exogenous (e.g., stress) or endogenous causes, the egocentric sensory inputs are unable to update the contents of the stored allocentric representation of the body. In other words, these patients are locked in an allocentric (observer view) negative image of their body, which their sensory inputs are no longer able to update even after a demanding diet and a significant weight loss. This article discusses the possible role of virtual reality in addressing this problem within an integrated treatment approach based on the allocentric lock theory.},
